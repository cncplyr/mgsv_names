#Metal Gear Solid-style code name generator.#

Sometimes, this will generate an 'uncommon' or even a 'rare' code name.

To add new names, you can edit the adjectives.txt, animals.txt, or rares.txt files. Uncommons are stored in the python script itself at the moment.

The textfiles may disappear in favor of a SQLite database in the future, although this version will live on in a different branch.
